Simple emulator of Conway's Game of Life (though it's real more of an automation)

Rules:
A cell must have 2 or 3 neighbors to continue living in the next cycle
A dead cell with 3 neighbors will be born in the next cycle

It currently randomly generates an initial board on execution of about 1/4th the amount of pixels available. 

Features I'm looking to add:
-An initial menu to choose between randomly generating a board or creating your own initial board by clicking what cells you want
-Preset boards that display interesting patterns that arise from the game.
